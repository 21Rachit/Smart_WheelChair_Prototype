# Smart_WheelChair_Prototype
WORKFLOW:

1: The smart wheelchair will be controlled by the hand gesture movement of the patient so the manual task of rotating it by hand will be reduced. 

2: The technology used is rfid sensor and accelerometer and other electronic components.

3: Then we have used object detection algorithm to identify the objects present in front of the webcam attached to the wheelchair. 

4: We have used tensorflow module and coco dataset to train our model. 

5: We can also detect the type of object present (like temperature,humidity) using different sensors.

6: If the object is detected, the wheelchair has to avoid the obstacle and move to the safest path all by itself.

7: (this we have achieved by using ultrasonic sensors and servo motors attached to raspberry pie since coding in python was easy)

8: Then final part was locating the position of the patient. This can be done by anyone sitting far away from the hospital using a single click. 

9: (for this we have used the technology of web automation using uipath tool. It automatically connects to the google map or track patient ip address to collect his address.)
